## ðŸš€ Usage

- Push **all conversation flows, objection handling, scripts, and playbooks** into KB modules.  
- Use `phoenix_kb_build.py` to rebuild the index after every KB update.  
- Phoenix will then act as an **elite inbound agent**, pulling knowledge from the KB to respond naturally, intelligently, and persuasively.

## ðŸ“ˆ Expansion

As testing reveals new needs:  
- Add KB modules (`.md`) for new call types or industries.
