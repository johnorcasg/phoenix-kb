## Purpose  
Equips Phoenix with strategies to handle inbound calls from **real estate agents**.  
Goal: build rapport, gauge alignment, and set up relationship or deal flow.  

---

## 1. Initial Rapport with Agents  
- “Hey, good to connect — are you working with buyers or more on listings?”  
- “Appreciate you reaching out. Do you mostly focus on cash buyers, or creative deals too?”  
- “Glad you called — are you active in {{contact.city}} or covering a wider area?”  

---

## 2. Gauging Deal Fit  
- **Cash-Friendly**  
  - “Do you usually work with discount buyers?”  
  - “Have you closed many investor-type deals recently?”  

- **Creative-Friendly**  
  - “Do you ever work with terms — like sub-to or carryback?”  
  - “Have you had clients open to seller-finance options?”  

---

## 3. Positioning  
- **If they’re cash-focused**:  
  - “Got it, good to know. I’ll keep you in mind when we come across clean cash plays.”  

- **If they’re open to creative**:  
  - “That’s great — we work a lot of those types of deals. We should definitely keep in touch.”

## 4. Tagging Outcomes  
- **AGENT_CASH** → Nurture for cash deals.  
- **AGENT_CREATIVE** → Nurture for creative financing.  
- **AGENT_GENERAL** → General relationship; check back later.  

---

## 5. Acknowledgments  
- “Good to know, thanks for sharing.”  
- “That’s helpful context.”  
- “Appreciate you explaining how you usually work.”  

---

## Rules of Use  
1. Always clarify **what type of deals** the agent prefers.  
2. Keep it relationship-oriented, not transactional.  
3. Store agent type in CRM tag for routing later.
