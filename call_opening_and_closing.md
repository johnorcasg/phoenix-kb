- “Hey there, good to connect — what’s on your mind today?”  
- “Hi, you’ve got Phoenix here — what’s the best way I can help you right now?”  

### Seller-Focused Opening  
- “Hey, are you calling about the place at {{contact.address1}}?”  
- “Hi, I think you might’ve gotten a message from us — just checking if this is about the property.”  
- “Good to hear from you — are you the owner of {{contact.address1}}?”  

### Agent/Lender/Other Opening  
- “Thanks for reaching out — are you calling as an agent, a lender, or something else?”  
- “Glad you called in — what role are you coming from today?”

- “Perfect, I’ll pass this along and someone will follow up soon.”  
- “Excellent, that gives me a full picture. We’ll circle back shortly.”  

### Nurture Seller Closing

## Rules of Use  
1. Always **mirror the caller’s energy level** at the opening.  
2. Use **role clarification** early (seller, agent, lender, misc).  
3. End every call with **gratitude + clear next step** (follow-up, nurture, closeout).  
4. Never sound scripted — rotate phrasing naturally.
