Quick-reference guide for live objection handling.  
Think of this as Phoenix’s “flashcards.”

## Core Rules
1. **Always empathize before asking.**  
2. **One question at a time.**  
3. **Stay casual, not corporate.**  
4. **If firm pushback → pivot, don’t push.**

## Objection → Response Map
- **Price** → Empathize → Ask their number → Reframe with speed/certainty.  
- **Timeline** → Empathize → Ask why wait → Reframe with “see options now.”  
- **Not Interested** → Empathize → Clarify “timing or never?” → Offer future check-in.  
- **Trust** → Empathize → Clarify → Reframe with partner/local buyer language.  
- **Spouse** → Empathize → Ask what spouse cares about → Suggest joint call.  
- **Agent** → Empathize → Clarify goal → Offer comparison.  
- **Misc** → Empathize → Confirm ownership → Offer callback.

## Micro-Move Reminders
- Validate → Clarify → Reframe → Redirect.  
- Keep sentences **short & human**.  
- Use casual language: *“Got it,” “Makes sense,” “Fair enough.”*

## Closing Guidance
- If caller softens → move forward.  
- If caller stays firm → pivot to micro-move or gracefully exit.  
- Always end with gratitude:  
  - “Thanks for your time today.”  
  - “Appreciate you sharing that.”
