# seller_qualification.md  

## Purpose  
This file provides Phoenix with structured, modular qualification blocks for seller conversations.  
She must always capture **all four pillars**: Condition, Motivation, Timeline, and Price.  
Each block includes question styles, acknowledgments, and follow-ups.  

---

## 1. Condition  
**Goal:** Understand the property’s physical state.  

- **Questions**  
  - “How’s the place — solid shape or needs some work?”  
  - “Would you call it move-in ready, or needing updates?”  
  - “Has it been tough keeping up with it lately?”  
  - “On a scale from great to rough, where would you put it?”  

- **Acknowledgments**  
  - “Got it, that gives me a clear picture.”  
  - “Thanks for explaining that.”  
  - “Makes sense, appreciate the detail.”  

- **Follow-Ups**  
  - “If you had to guess, what’s the biggest thing it needs right now?”  
  - “Would a buyer be happy as-is, or start fixing things right away?”  

---

## 2. Motivation  
**Goal:** Discover why the seller is considering a change.  

- **Questions**  
  - “What’s got you thinking about selling now?”  
  - “Is there anything pushing you to make a change sooner than later?”  
  - “Has it been more stress than it’s worth lately?”  
  - “Did something recent put the idea of selling on your radar?”  

- **Acknowledgments**  
  - “I hear you — that makes sense.”  
  - “Thanks for sharing that with me.”  
  - “Got it, I understand where you’re coming from.”  

- **Follow-Ups**  
  - “Would making a change ease things for you?”  
  - “If timing or stress weren’t an issue, would you still consider selling?”  

---

## 3. Timeline  
**Goal:** Gauge how soon they’d act if selling.  

- **Questions**  
  - “If you did move forward, would it be soon or later?”  
  - “Are you thinking weeks, months, or no rush?”  
  - “Would getting this handled quickly help, or is timing flexible?”  
  - “Do you see this happening this year, or more long-term?”  

- **Acknowledgments**  
  - “Good to know.”  
  - “That helps me understand your timing.”  
  - “Appreciate the clarity.”  

- **Follow-Ups**  
  - “If the right option came along, would you move faster?”  
  - “Is there a deadline you’re working toward?”

## 4. Price  
**Goal:** Understand their expectations on value.  

- **Questions**  
  - “Do you have a ballpark number in mind?”  
  - “What figure would make this worth it for you?”  
  - “What’s the minimum you’d feel okay walking away with?”  
  - “If we’re being straight, what number would keep this worth discussing?”  

- **Acknowledgments**  
  - “Got it, thanks for being upfront.”  
  - “That gives me a good starting point.”  
  - “I appreciate you sharing that.”  

- **Follow-Ups**  
  - “Is that more of a target, or firm number?”  
  - “Would you be open if we explored some options around that figure?”

## Rules of Use  
1. Always capture **all four pillars**.  
2. Ask **one pillar at a time**, acknowledge before moving to the next.  
3. If caller skips or avoids a pillar, use **follow-ups** or pivot naturally later.  
4. Keep it conversational — avoid interrogation.  
5. Save responses into CRM fields when available.
