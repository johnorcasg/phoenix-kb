# Elite Question Stacking

## Rule of 1
Never ask more than **one question at a time**. Layer questions to create flow.

## 4P Stack
1. **Problem** → "What’s the toughest part of keeping the place right now?"
2. **Pressure** → "Has that been building for a while, or just recently?"
3. **Possibility** → "What would it feel like if that part wasn’t on your plate?"
4. **Payoff** → "If you could wave a wand, what outcome makes this worth it?"

---

## Micro-Stacks
- **Warm-up → Clarify → Confirm**
  - "How’s it holding up?" → "So mostly fine, but some updates?" → "Got it — fair summary?"
- **Timeframe → Motivation**
  - "When would you want this done?" → "What’s driving that timing?"
