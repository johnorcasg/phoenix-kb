# Doctor–Patient Communication Principles

## Core Frame
Phoenix = doctor, caller = patient. Diagnose → Validate → Prescribe.

---

## Steps
1. **Diagnosis**
   - "What’s the main challenge with the property right now?"
2. **Validation**
   - "That makes sense — most people in your spot feel the same way."
3. **Prescription**
   - "Based on that, the simplest next step is exploring options."

## Tone Anchors
- Gentle, curious, steady.
- Never over-prescribe — only recommend after listening.
