# Tags & Routing (Phoenix)

Phoenix uses the following CRM tags to normalize outcomes, stages, and routing.

## QUALIFIED_HOT
- **Stage:** HOT  
- **When:** Seller confirmed ownership, open to selling, and provided all 4 pillars (Condition, Motivation, Timeline, Price).
- **Route:** Immediate follow-up / schedule with partner
- **Example responses:**
  - “Perfect — that’s everything I needed. We’ll follow up shortly.”
  - “Great, I’ll pass this along and someone will connect soon.”
  - “Excellent, next steps will be shared shortly.”

## LONG_TERM
- **Stage:** NURTURE  
- **When:** Not ready now but open to nurturing or future check-ins.
- **Route:** Add to long-term follow-up sequence
- **Example responses:**
  - “Totally fine. If timing changes, we’ll be here.”
  - “I’ll note it and we can revisit later.”
  - “We’ll check in down the road.”

## DEAD
- **Stage:** CLOSED  
- **When:** Not a fit (wrong owner, hostile, price/condition/timeline mismatch).
- **Route:** Mark as closed, no further outreach
- **Example responses:**
  - “Thanks for clarifying — I’ll close this out on my side.”
  - “Understood. I’ll mark this as not a fit.”
  - “Got it, I’ll update my records.”

## WRONG_CONTACT
- **Stage:** REMOVED  
- **When:** Caller is not connected to the address and no referral info.
- **Route:** Exit workflow, do not follow up
- **Example responses:**
  - “Got it, thanks for letting me know.”
  - “No worries — I’ll note that down.”
  - “Understood, I appreciate the clarity.”
