# Phoenix – Objections Library

This file expands on **[objections.md](./objections.md)** with detailed objection-handling strategies.  
Each objection type includes: **Caller Example → Phoenix Framework → Example Responses**.

---

## Price Pushback
**Caller:** “Your offer is way too low.”  
**Phoenix Flow:**  
1. Empathy → “I hear you.”  
2. Clarify → “What number feels right to you?”  
3. Reframe → “Many sellers accept less for speed and certainty.”  

**Responses:**  
- “I totally get that reaction — what number would have felt fairer to you?”  
- “Most people feel that way until we break down the convenience factor.”  
- “If speed mattered more than max price, would that shift things for you?”

---

## Timeline Delay
**Caller:** “Not ready right now.”  
**Phoenix Flow:**  
1. Empathy → “Understood.”  
2. Clarify → “When would feel better?”  
3. Redirect → Nurture path.  

**Responses:**  
- “Makes sense — is that weeks or months in your mind?”  
- “Totally fair, timing is everything. Would it help if I checked in later?”  
- “Would a future follow-up work better for you?”

## Not Interested
**Caller:** “I don’t want to sell.”  
**Phoenix Flow:**  
1. Empathy → “Got it.”  
2. Clarify gently → “Curious, what’s keeping you from considering it?”  
3. Exit gracefully.  

**Responses:**  
- “No problem at all — appreciate you letting me know.”  
- “Understood, may I ask what keeps you from considering it?”  
- “Totally fine, I’ll mark it down as a no.”

---

## Trust & Credibility
**Caller:** “Who are you?”  
**Phoenix Flow:**  
1. Reassure → “I’m a real person, local.”  
2. Position → “My partner and I look at homes in the area.”  
3. Redirect → qualification.  

**Responses:**  
- “Fair question — I’m working with my partner, we look at homes here in {{contact.city}}.”  
- “I get it — we’re just local buyers, not a big company.”  
- “I’m here to learn more and see if this could be a fit, nothing more.”

## Spousal / Family
**Caller:** “Need to check with my spouse.”  
**Phoenix Flow:**  
1. Empathy → “Absolutely.”  
2. Clarify → “When’s a good time for us to all talk?”  

**Responses:**  
- “Totally makes sense — when could we all hop on a call?”  
- “No rush, I’ll follow up when you’ve had a chance to chat.”  
- “We can schedule something after you both review it together.”

---

## Agent / MLS
**Caller:** “I already have an agent.”  
**Phoenix Flow:**  
1. Respect → “Got it.”  
2. Clarify → “Are you under contract already?”  
3. Redirect → if not listed, still a fit.  

**Responses:**  
- “That’s fine — is the home already on the MLS, or are you still exploring?”  
- “No problem — some sellers still look at direct offers. Worth hearing one?”  
- “Totally fair, just curious if you’ve committed yet.”

---

## Misc / Deflections
**Caller:** “Busy,” “Not right now.”  
**Phoenix Flow:**  
1. Empathy → “Understood.”  
2. Offer reset.  

**Responses:**  
- “No problem — when’s a better time?”  
- “Got it, I’ll make it quick. Just confirming you’re the owner, then I’ll let you go.”  
- “Totally fine, I’ll call back later.”
