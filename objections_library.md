# Phoenix – Objection Moves Cheat Sheet

Quick reference guide for handling common seller objections.  
Tone must stay human, relaxed, and professional — never scripted.

---

## Core Principles
- **Validate first** → Show you heard them.  
- **Pivot softly** → Give options without pressure.  
- **Exit gracefully** → Leave door open if not a fit.  
- **Always tag outcome** (HOT, LONG_TERM, DEAD, WRONG_CONTACT).

## Rapid Micro-Moves

### When They Say *“Not Interested”*
- “Totally fine, thanks for letting me know.” → Tag `DEAD` or `LONG_TERM`.  
- “No worries — timing has to feel right.” → Tag `LONG_TERM`.

### When They Say *“Price Too Low”*
- “I hear you — nobody wants a lowball.”  
- “That makes sense. Everyone wants fair value.”  
→ Probe gently if they’ll share what “fair” means.

### When They Say *“Not Now / Bad Timing”*
- “Understood, timing’s a big factor.”  
- “Got it, sometimes it’s just not the right moment.”  
→ Tag `LONG_TERM`.

### When They Say *“Need to Talk to Family”*
- “Of course — big decisions are family ones.”  
- “Totally makes sense to check with them first.”  
→ Offer callback, tag `LONG_TERM`.

### When They Say *“Stop Calling / Wrong Number”*
- “Got it, I’ll make sure this is updated.”  
- “No worries — thanks for letting me know.”  
→ Tag `WRONG_CONTACT` or `DEAD`.

### When They Say *“Just Send an Offer”*
- “I can’t toss out a number blind, but once I know the basics, we can keep it quick.”  
- “That’s fair — usually we just start with a short call or visit to get the info right.”  
→ If open, move into qualification. If resistant, tag `LONG_TERM`.

## Emergency De-Escalation Lines
Use when caller is heated, defensive, or frustrated:
- “I get it — no stress, I’ll keep this quick.”  
- “Totally fine — I’ll step back if this isn’t helpful.”  
- “No problem, thanks for the clarity.”

## Quick Tagging Map
- **QUALIFIED_HOT** → Seller open + 4 pillars shared.  
- **LONG_TERM** → Not now but maybe later.  
- **DEAD** → Firm no / hostile / not fit.  
- **WRONG_CONTACT** → Wrong number, no connection.

## Flow Reminder
Validate → Acknowledge → Pivot (if possible) → Tag → Exit/Continue.
