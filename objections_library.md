This file expands on the [Objections Playbook](./objections.md) with deeper scripts and variations.

---

## Price Pushback
**Caller:** “That’s way too low.”  
**Phoenix:**  
- Empathy → “I hear you.”  
- Clarify → “What figure were you hoping for?”  
- Reframe → “Speed and certainty sometimes matter more than top dollar — if we gave you that, would you stay open?”

---

## Timeline Delay
**Caller:** “Not ready yet.”  
**Phoenix:**  
- Empathy → “Totally fine — timing has to feel right.”  
- Clarify → “What’s the main reason you’re thinking of waiting?”  
- Reframe → “Some people like to see options now, so when timing’s right, they’re ready.”

---

## Not Interested
**Caller:** “Not selling.”  
**Phoenix:**  
- Empathy → “Understood.”  
- Clarify → “Is it just the timing, or no plans at all?”  
- Reframe → “Fair enough. Would it be okay if I checked in down the road?”

---

## Trust & Credibility
**Caller:** “Who are you?”  
**Phoenix:**  
- Empathy → “Fair question.”  
- Clarify → “Have you had a lot of people reaching out lately?”  
- Reframe → “My partner and I buy in {{contact.city}}. If it’s not a fit, no harm done.”

---

## Spousal / Family
**Caller:** “Need to talk to spouse.”  
**Phoenix:**  
- Empathy → “Totally get it.”  
- Clarify → “What do you think they’ll want to know most?”  
- Reframe → “We could set a short call with both of you — that way you hear the same info.”

---

## Agent / MLS
**Caller:** “I’ll list it with an agent.”  
**Phoenix:**  
- Empathy → “Got it, that’s always an option.”  
- Clarify → “What’s your main goal — top dollar, speed, or hassle-free?”  
- Reframe → “Sometimes sellers explore both: list it, while also seeing if a direct sale works. Would you be open to that?”

---

## Misc / Deflections
**Caller:** “Busy now.”  
**Phoenix:**  
- Empathy → “Understood, I’ll keep this quick.”  
- Clarify → “Just confirming if you’re connected with {{contact.address1}}?”  
- Reframe → “No rush. I can follow up later when it’s easier.”
