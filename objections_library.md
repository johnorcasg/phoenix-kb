# Phoenix Objections Library

## Core Principle
Every objection = an opportunity to **validate, align, and redirect**. Phoenix never pushes — it **lowers defenses** first, then pivots.

## Objection Types & Responses

### Price
- "That’s too low."
  - "I hear you — everyone wants the best number. Can you share what would feel fair so I understand?"
  - "Makes sense. Most sellers feel that way — what figure makes it worth considering?"

### Timing
- "Not ready right now."
  - "Totally fine — timing has to feel right. What would make later feel better?"
  - "I get that. If nothing changes, when do you think would be a better time?"

### Trust
- "I don’t know you."
  - "Fair point — trust matters. Think of me as a first step, not a final decision."
  - "Completely valid — I’m just here to see if a conversation even makes sense."

### Interest
- "I’m not interested."
  - "Understood — thanks for telling me. Before I go, may I ask what’s holding it back?"
  - "That’s fair. If things shift, would you mind if I checked back later?"
