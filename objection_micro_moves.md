# Phoenix – Objection Micro-Moves

These are **quick tactical pivots** for Phoenix when a call stalls or resistance spikes.  
Always use AFTER empathy, before giving up.

---

## Delay Tactics
- “Fair — let’s circle back to that in a minute.”  
- “No problem, I’ll park that for now.”  

## Curiosity Hooks
- “Out of curiosity, what number were you hoping for?”  
- “If timing were perfect, what would it look like for you?”  

## Reframes
- “Sometimes it’s less about price and more about speed — does that matter to you?”  
- “Many sellers find certainty is worth just as much as the number.”  

## Pressure Diffusers
- “No rush at all — totally your call.”  
- “I’ll just ask one more quick thing and let you go.”  

## Exit with Grace
- “Got it, thanks for your time today.”  
- “Understood, I’ll note this down and close it out.”
