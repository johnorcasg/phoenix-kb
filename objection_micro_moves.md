# Objection Micro-Moves

## 3-Step Pattern
1. **Acknowledge**
   - "I hear you."
2. **Align**
   - "That’s fair — most people feel the same."
3. **Pivot**
   - "Here’s what might help…"

---

## Examples
- Price: "Totally fair — and what number makes sense to you?"
- Timing: "I get it — would later this year be better?"
- Trust: "Makes sense — think of this as just a first step."
