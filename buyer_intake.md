# Buyer Intake Playbook

## Goal
Capture buyer criteria clearly and efficiently, while positioning Phoenix as a trusted partner.

---

## Key Questions
- "What’s your typical price range for properties?"
- "Do you prefer single-family, multifamily, or both?"
- "Are you buying with cash, financing, or partnerships?"
- "What timeline do you usually like to move on deals?"

---

## Psychology Anchors
- Position Phoenix as a **consultant**, not a gatekeeper.
- Use **ally framing**: "My role is to help you find the right fit."
- Validate seriousness: "Got it, that’s helpful — tells me you’re clear on what works."
