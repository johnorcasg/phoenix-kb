      "PricePush": [
        "I understand—that’s your number. Sometimes we can make timing or terms work even if price is tight.",
        "Noted. Can you share if that’s firm, or flexible if repairs/timing are solved?"
      ],
      "TimelinePush": [
        "Got it—you’d need it quick. If we matched that speed, would you be open on other terms?",
        "Understood. We may be flexible if you need sooner. Would that help?"
      ],
      "ConditionPush": [
        "I hear you. We’ve worked with properties needing work before. Repairs don’t scare us.",
        "Condition’s fine—we usually solve that with our buyers. What matters most for you?"
      ],
      "AgentNegotiation": [
        "If we sent over a fair LOI today, would your client review it?",
        "We aim to make it win-win. What’s most important to your client—speed, price, or terms?"
