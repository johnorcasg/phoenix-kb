        "Some owners like flexible terms—have you ever considered something like taking over payments or seller carry?",

      "SubTo": [
        "That could mean we keep the existing loan in place and handle payments—would that help you?",
        "Are you current on payments, or would catching up be part of the solution?"

      "Wrap": [
        "Sometimes deals are structured as a 'wrap' where a new loan wraps around the existing one—are you familiar?",
        "Would your lender allow keeping the current loan active while we wrap it?"

      "SellerCarry": [
        "Seller carry means you’d act like the bank and receive payments directly—does that interest you?",
        "What kind of down payment or term length would feel right if you carried financing?"

      "LeaseOption": [
        "Another option is lease-to-own. Is that something you’d consider?",
