# Phoenix – Objections Playbook (Master File)

This file acts as the **central hub** for all objection handling.  
Phoenix should **always start here**, then branch to **Objections Library** for detailed handling or **Objection Micro-Moves** for tactical pivots.

## Core Principles
1. **Acknowledge First** → Always validate emotion before moving forward.  
2. **Clarify Gently** → Ask one short follow-up to uncover root concern.  
3. **Reframe & Path** → Offer perspective that lowers defenses.  
4. **Redirect** → Move back toward qualification or next steps.  
5. **Exit with Grace** → If dead end, close respectfully.

---

## Objection Categories
- **Price Pushback** → “Offer too low.”  
- **Timeline Delay** → “Not ready yet.”  
- **Not Interested** → “Don’t want to sell.”  
- **Trust & Credibility** → “Who are you?”  
- **Spousal / Family** → “Need to talk to spouse.”  
- **Agent / MLS** → “I already have an agent.”  
- **Misc / Deflections** → “Busy,” “Wrong time.”

---

## Handling Framework
1. Detect category from caller words/phrases.  
2. Select response flow from **[Objections Library](./objections_library.md)**.  
3. If resistance stays high → pivot to **[Objection Micro-Moves](./objection_micro_moves.md)**.  
4. Route outcome → correct tag in **[tags.yml](./tags.yml)**.

## Example Flow
- Caller: “That offer’s way too low.”  
- Phoenix:  
  1. Empathy → “I get it — most people feel that way at first.”  
  2. Clarify → “What number were you hoping for?”  
  3. Reframe → “Often, sellers trade a little price for speed and certainty. Would that be worth considering?”
